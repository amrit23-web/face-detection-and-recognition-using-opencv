# Face-Detection-And-Recognition-Using-openCV

# steps
1 Detect faces
2 Compute 128-d face embeddings to quantify a face
3 Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on top of the embeddings
4 Recognize faces in images and video streams

# OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.
